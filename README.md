Accessibility

## Description
I refactored existing code to improve the accessibility of the website.
-   Semantic HTML elements is used and follows a logical structure.
-   Images have alternative text.
-   Website has a concise title of Horiseon.
-   Navigation links to the correct sections.  

Also, I learned what it means to refactor code.
