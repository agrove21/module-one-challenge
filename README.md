# module-one-challenge

## Description
I refactored existing code to improve the accessibility of the website.
-   Semantic HTML elements is used and follows a logical structure.
-   Images have alternative text.
-   Website has a concise title of Horiseon.
-   Navigation links to the correct sections. 
-   Increased font size of paragraphs.
-   Heading attributes are in sequential order.

Also, I learned what it means to refactor code. It means to restructure the existing code without changing the behavior or functionality.
